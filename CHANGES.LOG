1. (New Feature) Created the GLODERSBatch that allows the execution of a set of combinatorial

   files containing the parts of the SCENARIOS.XML to generate and run the simulation.
   
2. Change the Not Pay utility function

FROM
double TnotPayIG = (extortion - benefit) - (punishment * this.mafiaPunisherRep.getReputation());

TO
double TnotPayIG = -1 * (punishment * this.mafiaPunisherRep.getReputation());

----------
1. Removed Reputation information from Consumer output and Decision information from Purchase
   output to improve simulation execution

2. Added the possibility to define the Network topology between MESH and SCALEFREE

3. Added the possibility to cluster the Citizens of the same group

1. Fixed a bug regarding the Denounce Norm


08/03/2015
----------
1. Fixed Mafiosi output logging

2. Entrepreneurs and Consumers consider their own actions in the Norm Salience calculation

3. New feature allowing the log of Entrepreneurs and Consumers in certain intervals instead of
   only at the end of the simulation. XML TAG <loggingTimeUnit> added.
   
4. Fixed the replication feature that was not reseting the data structures and time 

19/02/2015
----------
1. Fixed an error on the OutputController that was not using the timeToWrite parameter

2. Changed the DenounceExtortion and DenouncePunishment in order to make a denounce less probable
   only in the case in which the salience to Denounce is very high. A DENOUNCE_FACTOR configuration
   parameter was hard-coded with value 5. In the future, this will become a configuration parameter. 
   

14/01/2015
