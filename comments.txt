----------
1. Fixed an error on the OutputController that was not using the timeToWrite parameter

2. Changed the DenounceExtortion and DenouncePunishment in order to make a denounce more probable
   only in the case in which the salience to Denounce is very high. A DENOUNCE_FACTOR configuration
   parameter was hard-coded with value 5. In the future, this will become a configuration parameter.
